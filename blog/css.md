The FartLabs scientists are pleased to announce the release of our signature
open-source CSS library, Fart.css! This library was developed to streamline the
creation and maintenance of consistent website design across our projects.

Let's dive into our latest creation!

## The Web was shitty to begin with

The documentation website <https://css.fart.tools/> has a complete Fart.css
walkthrough, but we wanted to give you a quick peek!

## Design considerations

Fart.css adopts an opinionated approach to design, offering a standardized set
of CSS classes and HTML tag targeting. This methodology allows developers to
write minimal CSS while ensuring compatibility with Fart.css styles.
Additionally, Fart.css seamlessly integrates with existing CSS libraries,
encouraging a modular development environment.

## How it's made

For organizational purposes, the source code is segmented into files based on
specific design concepts within the library. This compartmentalization
simplifies maintenance and facilitates code comprehension.

A significant advantage of utilizing pure CSS lies in its inherent simplicity.
Fart.css requires 0 build steps, streamlining development workflows.

## Fart.css in action

Fart.css plays a pivotal role in various projects undertaken by FartLabs.
Additionally, the developer community has adopted Fart.css for personal
projects, further demonstrating its effectiveness in accelerating development.
Examples include:

- <https://fart.tools/>: FartLabs landing page.
- <https://css.fart.tools/>: Fart.css documentation website.
- <https://concentration.fart.tools/>: Concentration game.
- <https://etok.me/>: Personal website of Ethan.

## In honor of Halloween

In the spirit of Halloween, Fart.css will undergo a temporary transformation
during the Halloween week. This will primarily manifest as a thematic color
palette shift. Developers can leverage this feature by incorporating Fart.css
during the Halloween week or by utilizing the "?halloween" URL query parameter
for year-round access to the spooky theme, i.e.
<https://css.fart.tools/?halloween>.

## Feedback wanted

This release marks the foundation for Fart.css. The development team actively
seeks feedback from the community to optimize future iterations of the library.
