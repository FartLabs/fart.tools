We're excited to introduce Fart Concentration, a fun and challenging memory game
that will test your auditory memory skills.

[Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) is a memory
game where you match pairs of cards. Click on a card to reveal its sound. Click
on another card to reveal its sound. If the sounds match, the cards stay face
up. If the sounds do not match, the cards flip back over. The game is over when
all cards are face up!

The player is able to choose the
[even number](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number) of cards they want
to play with. The game also features a timer to track how long it takes to
complete the game.

The player is also able to study each sound as many times as they want before
starting the game. This feature is especially useful for players who are new to
the game and want to familiarize themselves with the sounds before starting.
