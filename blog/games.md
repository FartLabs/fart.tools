At FartLabs, we're passionate about developer tools, but we also love creating
interactive experiences that spark creativity. That's why we explore new and old
tech to build fun games that push the boundaries of what's possible!

## Fart Concentration

We're excited to introduce _Fart Concentration_, a fun and challenging memory
game puts your auditory memory skills to the test.

- Play online: <https://concentration.fart.tools>
- Source code: <https://github.com/FartLabs/concentration>

This game features a variety of **fart sounds** that you must match to win.

[Concentration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)) is a memory
game where you match pairs of cards. Click on a card to reveal its sound. Click
on another card to reveal its sound. If the sounds match, the cards stay face
up. If the sounds do not match, the cards flip back over. The game is over when
all cards are face up!

The player is able to choose the
[even number](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Even_number) of cards they want
to play with. The game also features a timer to track how long it takes to
complete the game.

The player is also able to [_study_](https://concentration.fart.tools/sounds)
each sound as many times as they want before starting the game. This feature is
especially useful for players who are new to the game and want to familiarize
themselves with the sounds before starting.
