In today's digital world, software is crucial in how we work, connect, and
explore. However, many applications prioritize generic functionality over
individual needs. We believe software should be an extension of ourselves,
adaptable and responsive to our unique preferences.

Inspired by philosophies like the
[Semantic Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_Web), we aim to develop
software primitives that empower users. These building blocks will enable
seamless integration between different applications, allowing users to create
personalized experiences that truly serve their needs.

## Software as unique as you are

Personal computing has the potential to be a deeply personalized experience, a
digital extension of ourselves. Yet, the software we rely on often falls short
of this ideal. While we have the tools to connect with others, capture moments,
and explore the world, the underlying software is designed for a generic
"average user." This one-size-fits-all approach stifles individuality and limits
the potential of our devices. Much like passing gas in a quiet room, we're
forced to adapt to the software, rather than the software adapting to us.

Individuals from around the world have joined the movement to reclaim personal
computing.

Inspired by decades of science fiction and technological advancements, we gained
the opportunity to shape a future where technology truly serves our needs. By
challenging the biased, self-serving agendas and walled gardens that dominate
the tech industry, we can take control of our digital experiences.

## Our vision

The vision of the Semantic Web emphasizes a connected information space where
diverse systems can understand and interpret data. We believe this approach can
revolutionize personal computing.

Our software primitives will leverage Semantic Web principles to allow users to
easily integrate functionalities between different applications. This empowers
you to choose the necessary tools and build a personalized digital environment
that seamlessly fits your workflow and preferences.

Imagine being able to customize your communication app to work flawlessly with
your calendar or create a personalized dashboard that aggregates data from
various sources, all based on your specific needs. This is the future we strive
towards.

## Family tradition

Our mission wouldn't exist without the inspiration of a truly unique individual
— my late uncle, Gregory Davidson. Uncle Gregory wasn't just a man who loved a
good fart joke (and let's be honest, who doesn't?), he was utterly dedicated to
the comedic power of flatulence.

His passion manifested in the form of the "Fart Movie" serious - a self-made
collection of the funniest and most informative fart moments from popular movies
and television shows. But Gregory's ambition went beyond mere compilation. He
wrote, directed, animated, and even narrated some original scenes.

Gregory was also Deaf since birth, and our close friendship gave me perspective
into how hearing-impaired people experience the world. It instilled in me a
lifelong appreciation for the diverse ways we communicate and connect in our own
unique ways.

FartLabs is, in many ways, an extension of Gregory's playful spirit. We want to
create a platform that celebrates the universal language of laughter, one that
transcends spoken words and embraces the joy of a good fart. We believe, just
like Gregory, that laughter breaks down barriers and connects us all.
